👋 Hey there! I'm a former React Native 📱 developer turned MERN stack 🌐 developer with a passion for creating innovative and efficient software solutions.

🎓 I discovered my love for coding during my college years, and have since honed my skills by enrolling in coding boot camps and gaining valuable experience in the tech industry.

⚛️ As a former React Native developer, I was responsible for developing mobile applications that could be used across both Android and iOS platforms. I gained experience working with various third-party libraries and APIs, which helped me to create high-performance, user-friendly applications.

👨‍💻 However, my curiosity for the latest web development technologies led me to switch to the MERN stack. I now specialize in developing web applications using MongoDB 🍃, Express 🚂, React ⚛️, and Node.js 🐱‍💻. My skills in this area have allowed me to create dynamic, scalable web applications that provide seamless user experiences.

🏢 Currently, I'm working at Lobees, where I'm responsible for developing and maintaining their web application. It's a fast-paced environment where I have the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies and collaborate with other talented developers.

🚀 I'm always eager to learn and grow as a developer, and I'm constantly exploring new technologies and techniques to improve my skills. I'm a firm believer in the power of collaboration and enjoy working with other developers to tackle complex problems and create amazing software solutions.

🌎 When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors or traveling to new places. I'm passionate about photography 📷, music 🎶, and staying active through hiking 🥾 and yoga 🧘‍♂️.
